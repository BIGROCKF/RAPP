    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use our iOS mobile application (the “App”).
      By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Content</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Images you upload for AI processing</li>
      <li>Text prompts or other inputs submitted for AI generation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The App does not display third-party advertisements.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To create and manage user accounts</li>
      <li>To provide AI-generated results requested by the user</li>
      <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the App</li>
      <li>To respond to support or technical inquiries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. AI Processing and Data Transmission</h2>

    <p>
      When a user uploads an image or submits text input for AI generation, this content is securely transmitted
      through our server infrastructure and forwarded to Fal AI (fal.ai) solely for the purpose of accessing
      artificial intelligence models and generating the AI results requested by the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before any image or text input is transmitted to Fal AI, users are clearly informed within the App
      and must explicitly consent to this data transmission.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Uploaded images and text inputs are used exclusively for AI result generation.</li>
      <li>We do not use user content for advertising, marketing, or profiling purposes.</li>
      <li>We do not sell user data to any third parties.</li>
      <li>User content is temporarily processed and automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Fal AI processes the transmitted data solely for providing AI model access and processing services.
      To the best of our knowledge, Fal AI does not use submitted data for independent marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases (Credits and Subscriptions)</h2>

    <p>
      The App operates using a credit-based and/or subscription system. Credits and subscriptions can be purchased
      through Apple’s In-App Purchase system.
    </p>

    <p>
      All payments are processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not receive, store, or process payment card
      information or financial data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We may share user information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With Fal AI (fal.ai) solely for the purpose of processing user-submitted images and text inputs
        to generate AI results.
      </li>
      <li>When required by applicable law, regulation, or legal process.</li>
      <li>As part of Apple’s in-app purchase infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect user information.
      However, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by revising
      the "Last Updated" date above.
